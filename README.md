## Introduction

This Angular 16 project implements an Authentication Module that includes login and signup components. It provides a foundation for user authentication within your application. By following this README, you can easily understand how to set up, use, and customize the authentication features.

## Features

- User registration and signup.
- User login with authentication.
- Secure password handling.
- Authentication guards for protected routes.
- Angular 16 compatibility.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your development environment.
- Angular CLI globally installed (`npm install -g @angular/cli`).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akanshacode/angular16structure
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd angular16structure
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Authentication

The authentication module provides a secure way to manage user authentication. It includes the following features:

- **Login**: Users can log in with their credentials.
- **Signup**: New users can create accounts.

### Login Component

The login component is accessible at `/auth/login` and provides the following functionality:

- Input fields for username and password.
- Validation of user input.
- Authentication with the backend server.
- Redirect to a protected dashboard upon successful login.

To use the login component in your application, include it in your routing configuration and add an appropriate route guard.

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'auth/login',
    component: LoginComponent,
  },
  {
    path: 'auth/signup',
    component: SignupComponent,
  }
];
```

### Signup Component

The signup component is accessible at `/auth/signup` and allows new users to create accounts. It provides the following features:

- Registration form with fields for username, email, and password.
- Validation of user input.
- User account creation and storage on the backend server.

To use the signup component, follow a similar approach as for the login component, adding it to your routing configuration and implementing the necessary route guard.

## Folder Structure

The project follows a standard Angular project structure, with the authentication module residing in the `auth` folder. Below is a simplified structure:

```
